- Here is the original [Elman Network publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1402_1/abstract) from 1990. This link is provided here as it's a significant milestone in the world on RNNs. To simplify things a bit, you can take a look at the following [additional info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network#Elman_networks_and_Jordan_networks).
